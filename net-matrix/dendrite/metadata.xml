Dendrite is a second-generation Matrix homeserver written in Go. It intends to provide an efficient, reliable and scalable alternative to Synapse.
As of October 2020, Dendrite has entered beta.
Currently, the authors expect Dendrite to function well for small (10s/100s of users) homeserver deployments as well as P2P Matrix nodes in-browser or on mobile devices. In the future, it will be capable of scaling up to gigantic servers (equivalent to matrix.org) via polylith mode.
